# News Feed Reader Testing

This project uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

To run this project, open the [index.html](http://ctirpak.github.io/p6) file. Each of the test cases will run and the results will be displayed at the bottom of the page.

### Test Cases Written:

This project contains a number of test cases that are used to validate various functionality of the project.

The test cases validate that:

1. the allFeeds object has URLs and Names and are not empty.
2. the menu element is hidden by default.
3. the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
4. after the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
5. when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function the content actually changes.
